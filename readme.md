# Synquivalents
My first web design project, this is a prototype of a laboratory notebook web app for Synthetic Chemists. It's purpose is mainly as a way for me to familiarize myself with Ruby on Rails, general web development, and the associated languages.

A functioning version of this project is available here:
[synquivalents.cleave.land](http://synquivalents.cleave.land/)

**Project is on-going and currently incomplete**
